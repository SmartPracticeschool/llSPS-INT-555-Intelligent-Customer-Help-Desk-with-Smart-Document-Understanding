Project Description: 
The conventional customer care chatbots are designed to answer questions that are straight-forward. 
They deal with questions outside the fixed set either telling the customer that the question is not valid or direct them to a person. Unlike these traditional chatbots, this project will have an additional option to deal with these outside the scope questions. If the question is regarding the operation of a device, the developed application will delegate it to Watson Discovery Service, which is pre-loaded with the device's owner manual. The advantage of this option being that, instead of asking the customer whether he/she would like to speak to a customer representative, we will be returning the pertinent sections of the owners manual to resolve the customer's issues. The project in addition will be employing Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to teach the application on what text of the owners manual is significant and what is not. Doing this will ameliorate the replies that are returned from the queries.
